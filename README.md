# Sem06-SoftwareEngineering

### Course Overview
This repository contains the final project for the **Software Engineering** course taken in my sixth semester. The course covered all aspects of creating an information system, from gathering requirements to designing the system architecture. We learned to apply software engineering principles, including **UML diagrams**, **use case specifications**, and **resource planning**. This project, an e-commerce platform where users can buy media and manage their purchases, demonstrates the full lifecycle of software development.

### Project Overview: Media Store Information System
The final project is an **e-commerce platform** that allows users to:
- Browse and purchase digital media.
- Add purchased items to their personal profile.
- Manage and interact with their purchases within the system.

### Key Deliverables and Documentation
This project includes extensive documentation, including:
- **Requirements Analysis**: Requirements were gathered and refined based on customer needs.
- **UML Diagrams**: Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, communication diagrams, and component diagrams were developed to capture system structure and behavior.
- **Prototyping**: Created mockups to visualize the user interface and user flow.
- **Project Management**: Documented project roles, resource allocation, and cost estimates.

All documentation is available on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H1ktfUyqFa7LCjuPbNCi6Mm4ASuOohPlyzdmbTrF_5A/edit?tab=t.0) and includes:
- Diagrams for system design.
- Use case specifications and communication diagrams.
- Team roles, resources used, and cost predictions.

### Key Features
- **User Profiles**: Users have profiles where purchased media is stored and managed.
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for all entities, including user accounts and media content.
- **Media Management**: Admins can add, edit, and delete media items in the store.
- **File Uploads**: Supports file and image uploads for media content.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap for UI components.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.
- **Database**: MySQL (or Oracle SQL, depending on setup).
- **Additional Libraries**: Axios for API requests, React Router for navigation.

### Project Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- React and MySQL set up locally

#### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/Misash/Bluetify.git
   $ cd Bluetify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

3. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   $ npm start
   ```

4. **Set up and start the backend**:
   ```bash
   $ cd server/
   $ npm install
   $ npm start
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
